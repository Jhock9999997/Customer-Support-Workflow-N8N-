Workflow Overview
This workflow monitors your Gmail inbox for new emails, classifies their content, and intelligently processes customer support requests using an AI agent and contextual retrieval from a knowledge base.

Step-by-Step Process
1. Gmail Trigger
The workflow begins with a Gmail trigger that continuously watches the inbox for newly received messages.

2. Text Classification
Incoming emails are sent to a text classifier powered by an OpenAI model. Based on content analysis, emails are categorized into “Customer Support” or “Other”.

3. Conditional Logic
The flow splits depending on the classification result:

Customer Support Emails

The email is forwarded to an OpenAI Chat Model connected to an AI Agent.

The AI Agent uses a vector-based knowledge base (via OpenAI embeddings) to provide context-aware responses.

A label is added to the original email to help with inbox organization.

The AI then formulates and sends a reply through Gmail.

**Non-Support Emails

These are passed through a “No Operation” node, which ends the workflow without further processing.

Key Components
- Gmail Trigger: Monitors incoming messages in real time.

- Text Classifier (OpenAI): Categorizes emails using natural language understanding.

- AI Agent: Utilizes OpenAI’s chat capabilities and a vector database to generate intelligent responses.

- Knowledge Base: Stores context-rich embeddings to support accurate information retrieval.

- Gmail Actions: Adds labels to categorize messages and sends automated replies.
